### Hi there 👋


I graduated the Manchester Codes Fast Track Software Engineering bootcamp in March 2022.

I'm looking forward to continue my coding learning journey. Here's a few things that I'm currently learning:

- 🔭 I’m currently furthering my knowledge in JavaScript, React and TDD
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🎉 I just built my first full stack app with @heliDevine and @greenchul and thinking about another project! Watch this space. 
- 🧞‍♂️ I'd love to start my career in Software Engineering soon!
